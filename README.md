# NftBridge
## _Your First CrossChain NFT collection, Ever_

NftBridge is a NFT collection with Cross Chain compatiblity, ie can be brigded through multiple blockchains. Bridge is currently availble and supports two(2) blockchains currently: 

- Ethereum(Goerli Testnet)
- Polygon(Mumbai Testnet)


## Features

- A Collection of NFts deployed on-chain via [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech)
- Smart-Contracts deployed on Goerli and Mumbai Testnet networks.
- Minting of NFTs on both chains(Limited Supply)
- Bridging of NFTs from one chain to another via [LayerZero Omnichain Protocol](https://layerzero.network)

Cross Chain Compatiblity is the next step in the evolution of the Blockchain Technology. Possibilities like Cross-Chain Exchanges, Cross-Chain Yield Aggregators, Cross-Chain Lending, Cross-Chain DAOs and in this case [Cross-Chain NFTs]( https://bridgee-a3ae8.web.app).
As [Chainlink](https://chain.link) writes on the [Chainlink Blog](https://blog.chain.link) :

> This new design paradigm is a key step in the evolution of the 
> multi-chain ecosystem and has the potential to create entirely
> new categories of smart contract use cases that leverage the
> unique benefits of different blockchains, sidechains, and 
> layer-2 networks.

## Tech

Bridge uses a number of open source languages/librarys/frameworks to work properly:

- [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org) - Programming Language for the smart-contracts!
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org) - Framework for testing, compiling and deploying the smart-contracts.
- [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com) - Library for writing modular, reusable, secure smart contracts.
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) - Framework for the frontend.
- [dart_web3](https://pub.dev/packages/dart_web3) - Library for connection and interaction with the smart-contracts.
- [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech) - Blockchain for the storage of the NFT images and metadata.
- [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud) - Tool for easy deployment of NFT images and metadata to IPFS.
- [LayerZero](https://layerzero.network) - Framework for bridging of NFTs from one chain to another

And of course Bridge itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/Sangza/nftbridge)
 on GitHub. For a live preview of the Bridge DApp visit this [website]( https://bridgee-a3ae8.web.app).
